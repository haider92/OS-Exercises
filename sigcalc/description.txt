Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program consists of three main parts:

 - Reader thread
 - Calculator thread
 - Main function

Along with this it has a struct, `sharedData_t` for containing the required
information to be passed to the threads.

### Main Function:

The main function blocks `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` as they are used for
communications between the threads. It uses the `sharedData_t` struct to
populate parameters to be passed to the `reader` and `calculator` threads.

### Reader Thread:

The reader thread is open to accepting both `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. On
Recieving a `SIGUSR1` it will read the next two numbers from the specified file.
After reading the two numbers it will send a `SIGUSR1` to the calculator thread,
this informs it that data is available. On reaching EOF of the file, the reader
closes the stream it opened to the file, sends a `SIGUSR2` to the calculator
thread to tell it to stop, waits for a reply and then ends.

### Calculator Thread:

Waits until a signal is recieved. On Recieving a `SIGUSR1` it will take values 
from the parameters and calculate them, when completed it sends a SIGUSR1 to the
Reader thread. On recieving a `SIGUSR2` the thread will end itself.
