Problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program doesn't succcessfully error when a file containing a string instead
of a number is supplied.

The program will still print goodbye from both threads when a empty text file
is supplied.

The program may have issues with fscanf portability. It was only tested on the
lab machines and gcc version 3.3.3-hammer.

The program uses usleep which is obsolute.
